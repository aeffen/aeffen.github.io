<h1>Illustrating the Fundamentals of Neuroscience</h1>

<h2>MCB80.1x: The Electrical Properties of the Neuron</h2>

<p>After the first successful run of the course on the edX platform in 2018-19, I spent the summer reviewing content and feedback to see how we could do better. One thing we noticed was that many students felt they were being thrown in the deep end with Lesson 1, because we assumed a high level of familiarity with electricity and electronics concepts. To help these students ease into the course, I wrote and illustrated a new lesson about the basics of voltage. I also assisted a fellow content developer in creating a new problem-solving section to practice manipulating the Nernst equation.</p>

<h2>MCB80.3x: The Brain</h2>
<p>In addition to working on MCB80.1x, I helped to overhaul the video content of MCB80.3x. In addition to making corrections to lesson text and transcripts, I worked closely with <a href="http://www.raetastic.com">Rachel D'Erminio</a> and <a href="https://siobhanlandry.com/">Siobhan Landry</a> to design new graphics and animations for 14 of the 50 lesson videos. You'll have to view the live course to see the majority of the new content!</p>

When filling two balloons with water flowing at a constant rate, a stretchier balloon takes longer to reach its maximum pressure. In the context of the lesson, this is similar to a neuron with a higher capacitance (i.e. an unmyelinated axon).</p>
